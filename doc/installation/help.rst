IRC Channel
===========

The most immediate way to get hold of us is to join our IRC channel:

        ``#munin on server irc.oftc.net``

The main timezone of the channel is Europe+America.

If you can explain your problem in a few clear sentences, without too
much copy&paste, IRC is a good way to try to get help. If you do need
to paste log files, configuration snippets, scripts and so on, please
use a pastebin_.

If the channel is all quiet, try again some time later, we do have
lives, families and jobs to deal with also.

You are more than welcome to just hang out, and while we don't mind
the occasional intrusion of the real world into the flow, keep it
mostly on topic, and do not paste random links unless they are *really*
spectacular and intelligent.
