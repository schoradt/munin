Debian-specific information regarding Munin
===========================================

  Getting started
  ---------------

    Using Munin requires to run a Munin master, which needs the munin
    package installed and an arbitrary number of Munin nodes, with the
    munin-node package installed. The master can and should also be a node.

    On the master system point your browser to http://localhost/munin - to
    customize edit /etc/munin/apache.conf if you are using apache2.

    On the nodes, /etc/munin/munin-node.conf needs to be edited to allow
    access from the master node. Restart munin-node after any configuration
    change.

    Plugins reside in /usr/share/munin/plugins/, their usage is activated
    by linking them to /etc/munin/plugins/ (restart munin-node afterwards).
    Plugin configuration is best done in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/

  Allow non-local access to web interface
  ---------------------------------------

    By default access to the munin web interface is restricted to
    local requests.
    If you need to access the web interface remotely, you should replace
    all occurrences of "Require local" with "Require all granted" in
    /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/munin.conf and restart apache2.


  Performance considerations: generate visualization on-demand or via cron
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By default munin generates its HTML output and its graphs periodically
    (via cron). This is suitable for small installations.

    If performance is an issue (e.g. if one master is collecting data from
    dozens or hundreds of nodes), the visualization can also be configured
    to be generated on demand.
    The following steps are required for this change:
      * set "html_strategy" and/or "graph_strategy" to "cgi"
        (see /etc/munin/munin.conf and /etc/munin/munin-conf.d/)
      * adjust the apache configuration for munin
        (see the end of /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/munin.conf)
      * enable one of the CGI handlers for apache:
          * cgi: "a2enmod cgid"
          * fcgid: "apt install libapache2-mod-fcgid && a2enmod fcgid"
      * restart apache2 and visit http://localhost/munin/


  Using a different webserver (e.g. nxinx)
  ----------------------------------------

    Apache2 is preconfigured for the munin master web interface when
    installing the munin package.  Alternatively you may choose to
    serve the munin web interface with a different webserver.
    In this case you may want to configure socket activation for HTML
    and graph generation:

        cp /usr/share/doc/munin/examples/systemd-fastcgi/munin-* /etc/systemd/system/
        systemctl daemon-reload
        systemctl enable munin-graph.socket
        systemctl enable munin-html.socket
        systemctl start munin-graph.socket
        systemctl start munin-html.socket

    In case of nginx you can start with the included example
    configuration file:

        cp /usr/share/doc/munin/examples/nginx/munin.nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/munin.conf
        ln -s ../sites-available/munin.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
        service nginx restart

    Probably you should tweak the "listen" and "server_name" settings
    in this configuration file according to your needs.


  Find the upstream source
  ------------------------

    This Debian package uses the upstream tarball located here:
      http://downloads.munin-monitoring.org/

    It also uses quilt to apply some debian specific patches located in
    ./debian/patches/

    We've got a mailing list.  You'll find subscription information at
    <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/munin-users>.  All feedback
    are welcome.

    If you feel like sending us things that can't be represented in binary (for
    example beautiful people fluent in assembly, bacillus anthracis, cash,
    explosives, and so on), take contact off-list, and we'll find a way of
