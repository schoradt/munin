# Tests for master components:
#   * collect graphs
#   * generate html and png files
#
# Dependencies:
#   * apache2: handle HTTP requests
#   * cron (only sysV init): manually enforce a dependency conflict when switching to sysvinit-core
#   * curl: HTTP requests for munin-httpd
#   * daemontools: for "setuidgid"
#   * file: determine mime type of HTTP responses
#   * libcgi-fast-perl: required for delivery via apache2
#   * munin-node: provide data to be retrieved by the munin master
#   * munin-plugins-core: required for requesting plugin graphs via munin-httpd
#   * netcat-openbsd: test local tcp connection
#   * sharness: test framework
#
# Additional specified "restrictions" for SysV init tests:
#   * allow-stderr: apache2 emits the warning message
#     "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name".  It is harmless.
#     The message is only emitted with SysV init. With systemd a slightly different name resolution
#     seems to be in effect.  Thus we can ignore this output on stderr.
#   * skip-not-installable: some distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) do not ship sysvinit-core.  They
#     should be allowed to skip these tests.

#       munin-node. The reason for this hanging communication is not known (it works with systemd).
